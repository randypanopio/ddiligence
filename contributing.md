# Contributing Guidelines

*Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and highly encouraged!* :octocat:

# Setup <a name = "setup"></a>
The following document is for setting up the project to begin contributing.

Contributors should branch of the `staging` branch and merge their changes back to the `staging` branch (regardless of the application component), ideally with code review and apporoval before submission. Upon successful submisson (including tests & build verifications) the changes will be automatically be merged to the `main` branch. TODO succesful changes will be also pushed to the `production` branch and will be provisioned as a change for the next release build.
- Don't push changes to `main` manually unless you absolutely know what you are doing. We are all consenting developers here.
